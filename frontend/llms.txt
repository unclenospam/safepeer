# Safepeer

> Encrypted peer-to-peer chat in your browser. No accounts, no servers storing messages.

Safepeer is a private, encrypted chat application that connects users directly via WebRTC peer-to-peer connections. All messages and images are sent directly between browsers — the server only handles initial signaling to establish connections.

## Features

- End-to-end encrypted text messaging via WebRTC DataChannels
- Image sharing (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP) compressed and sent P2P
- Multiple chat channels within a room
- Message reactions and replies
- Typing indicators
- Custom user statuses
- Room sharing via invite links
- No accounts or sign-ups required
- No message history stored on any server

## How It Works

1. Create a room to get a unique room code
2. Share the code or invite link with others
3. Peers connect directly via WebRTC (STUN-assisted NAT traversal)
4. All chat messages and images flow peer-to-peer
5. A lightweight signaling server on Cloudflare Workers handles only the initial connection setup
